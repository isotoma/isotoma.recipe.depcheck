Changelog
=========

0.0.4 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


0.0.3 (2011-09-06)
------------------

- Report on all dependency requirements prior to raising a UserError
- The buildout-created bin/test now runs the unit recipe's unit tests
- Added option "action = warn" (default is "action = fail") to just alert the
  user to dependency failures, but allow the buildout to continue.
- Added option "current-user", to ensure that the buildout is being run as the
  required system user, e.g. "django".
- Added option "users" to ensure that particular users are present on the system
  WARNING however that this retrieves its user list from /etc/passwd, so LDAP
  and the likes are not supported.
- Added option "python" to check that the correct python version is being used.
  Multiple python versions are allowed, one-per-line. Only major and minor
  version numbers are accounted for, i.e. 2.6, NOT 2.6.3.


0.0.2 (2011-08-16)
