Changelog
=========

0.0.7 (2013-01-15)
------------------

- Checking for executables would error out if the file was missing. Now only
  tries to stat the file if it is there.


0.0.6 (2012-04-08)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


0.0.5 (2011-09-09)
------------------

- The locale option was opening and parsing the (ubuntu) locales file each time
  the recipe was run, regardless of whether or not the user specified "locale ="
  Now it doesn't.

0.0.4 (2011-09-07)
------------------

- Check dependencies when the recipe's __init__ method is called, not the
  install method, so that dependency checks are run as early as possible.


0.0.3 (2011-09-06)
------------------

- Report on all dependency requirements prior to raising a UserError
- The buildout-created bin/test now runs the unit recipe's unit tests
- Added option "action = warn" (default is "action = fail") to just alert the
  user to dependency failures, but allow the buildout to continue.
- Added option "current-user", to ensure that the buildout is being run as the
  required system user, e.g. "django".
- Added option "users" to ensure that particular users are present on the system
  WARNING however that this retrieves its user list from /etc/passwd, so LDAP
  and the likes are not supported.
- Added option "python" to check that the correct python version is being used.
  Multiple python versions are allowed, one-per-line. Only major and minor
  version numbers are accounted for, i.e. 2.6, NOT 2.6.3.


0.0.2 (2011-08-16)
------------------

- Better error handling
